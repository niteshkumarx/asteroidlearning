 <br><br><br><br><br><!--Start from here-->An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within a
 larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints.
 It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems
 control many devices in common use today. Embedded systems are commonly found in consumer, cooking, industrial, automotive, medical, commercial and military applications.

Telecommunications systems employ numerous embedded systems from telephone switches
 for the network to cell phones at the end-user. Computer networking uses dedicated
 routers and network bridges to route data. How it works? Apply Now.

 used to create the integrated circuits that are present in everyday electrical and electronic devices. It is a multiple-step sequence
 of photo lithographic and chemical processing steps during which electronic circuits are gradually created on a wafer made of pure
 semiconducting material. Silicon is almost always used, but various compound semiconductors are used for specialized applications.
<br><br>
The entire manufacturing process, from start to packaged chips ready for shipment, takes six to eight weeks and is performed
 in highly specialized facilities referred to as fabs.

<h3>Pig</h3>
<p>Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists
 of a high-level language for expressing data analysis programs, coupled
 with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. The salient property 
 of Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization,
 which in turns enables them to handle very large data sets.

At the present time, Pig's infrastructure layer consists of
 a compiler that produces sequences of Map-Reduce programs,
 for which large-scale parallel implementations already exist. 
 Pig's language layer currently has the following key properties.</p>
<p>
<br><br><span style="color:#FFFF00;">
<b>Ease of programming</b>: It is trivial to achieve parallel execution
 of simple, "embarrassingly parallel" data analysis tasks. Complex
 tasks comprised of multiple interrelated data transformations are
 explicitly encoded as data flow sequences, making them easy to
 write, understand, and maintain.<br>
<br><b>Optimization opportunities</b>: The way in which tasks are encoded permits 
the system to optimize their execution automatically,
 allowing the user to focus on semantics rather than efficiency.<br>
<br><b>Extensibility</b>: Users can create their own functions to do special-purpose processing.<br/>

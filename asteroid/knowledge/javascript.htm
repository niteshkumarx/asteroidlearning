<h3>Javascript</h3>
<p>Scripting is an essential ingredient in all games. Even the simplest game will
 need scripts to respond to input from the player and arrange for events in the gameplay
 to happen when they should. Beyond that, scripts can be used to create graphical effects,
 control the physical behaviour of objects or even implement a custom AI system for
 characters in the game.

Scripting is a skill that takes some time and effort to learn; the intention of this
 section is not to teach you how to write script code from scratch but rather to 
 explain the main concepts that apply to scripting in Game Development.</p>
<p>
Although you may choose from Javascript, C# or Boo Script when programming for games.Javascript is a dynamic scripting
 language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations
 allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.
 It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

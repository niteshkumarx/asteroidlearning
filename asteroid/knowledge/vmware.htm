<h3>VMware</h3>
<p>VMware Workstation is a virtual machine software that is used for x86 
or x86-64 computers to run multiple operating systems over a single physical
 host computer. Each virtual machine can run a single instance of any 
 operating system (Windows, Linux or else) simultaneously. VMware Workstation 
 strongly supports hardware compatibility and works as a bridge between 
 the host and virtual machine for all kinds of hardware resources including 
 hard disks, USB devices and CD-ROMs. All device drivers are installed via the host machine.</p>
<p>
If you're a beginner with linux and wish to only work on linux on part time above Windows then VMware is the best option. Infact 
its completely like a vitual second operating system running over the primary one.</p>

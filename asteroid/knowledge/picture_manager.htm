<h3>Office Picture Manager </h3>
<p>Microsoft Office Picture Manager has the ability to crop, resize, and convert images between various
 formats like Paint, but with comparably better picture quality, due to being able to select compression level.
It also supports several more advanced capabilities, such as batch editing/saving/renaming, fine-tuning
 of midtones, highlights, and shadows, and red-eye removal. It also has easy-to-use features such as
 one-click image compression, and resizing to a user's own choice. It does not however, offer any sort of actual drawing or text-editing tools.
One of its unique features is the ability to link and upload pictures to a Microsoft SharePoint picture
 library. Therefore, a user can easily share photos among team members over the Internet. It is also
 possible to easily export photos from the program to other Office programs, while allowing a user
 to specify custom image dimensions.</p>
<p>After you have finished editing your pictures, you may want to share them with your workgroup.
 You can send pictures in e-mail messages or create a shared picture library for a collaboration
 experience that features simplified administration and role-based permissioning, as well as a unique
 picture management model that enables users to download picture versions of any size or resolution,
 while efficiently storing the original pictures. When sharing pictures, keep in mind that you can
 compress them to a size that is most efficient for the way you intend to use the picture. Smaller
 file sizes display quicker on a Web page, take up less disk space, and, if you are sharing pictures
 by sending them in an e-mail message, they can be delivered faster.</p>

<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Java is a programming language and computing platform initially released by Sun Microsystems. 
There are lots of applications and websites that may not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day.
 Java is generally secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific 
 supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, a small amount of Java can seen everywhere.</p>
<p>Big Data Analytics uses Map-reduce algorithms which a generally formulated using Java. Unlike C Java uses object oriented programming
we need to write quite short codes as compared to C for getting jobs done. How so ever Java needs a virtual runtime environment, above the system operating system
to run its programs and JRE does that.</p>
<p>
The reason why Java is popular among programmers is because of its compactness and less lines of codes, however to get into some system programming you may have
to go with C.</p>

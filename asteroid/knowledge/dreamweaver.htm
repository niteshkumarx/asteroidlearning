<h3>Adobe Dreamweaver</h3>
<p>Adobe Dreamweaver is a web design and development application that combines
 a visual design surface known as Live View and a code editor with standard features
 such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and code collapsing as well as more
 sophisticated features such as real-time syntax checking and code introspection
 for generating code hints to assist the user in writing code. Combined with an
 array of site management tools, Dreamweaver lets its users design, code and
 manage websites as well as mobile content. Dreamweaver is positioned as a
 versatile web design and development tool that enables visualization of web content while coding.
Dreamweaver, like other HTML editors, edits files locally then uploads them to the remote web server using FTP.</p>
<p>There are some other popular editors too that can be used to develop web pages like Notepad++ and Komodo you
 may prefer either depending upon your suitability. But Dreamweaver remains one of the most popular professional
 web design programs available. It offers a lot of power and flexibility for both designers and developers.
 There are a lot of features, which can make it intimidating, but in general, it is easy to pick up and start
 using and the advanced features make it possible to go from beginning web designer to professional in a very short period of time.</p>

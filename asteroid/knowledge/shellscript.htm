<h3>Linux Shell Scripting</h3>
<p>Its a Command-Line Interpretor that connects a user to Operating System
 and allows to execute the commands or by creating text script. If you are familier to MS DOS then
 you might be familier to operate a computer system using commands</p>
<p>Shell scripts allow several commands that would be entered manually
 at a command-line interface to be executed automatically, and without
 having to wait for a user to trigger each stage of the sequence. For
 example, in a directory with three C source code files, rather than 
 manually running the four commands required to build the final program
 from them, one could instead create a C shell script, here named build 
 and kept in the directory with them, which would compile them automatically.</p>
<p>
Getting nervous? No, you dont need to it seems difficult when it comes for typing each and every code but believe
its actually fun once you're used to it. And not to mention since Linux is the industry standard for operating systems
it adds a lot of values to your skills once you're familier with Linux.</p>

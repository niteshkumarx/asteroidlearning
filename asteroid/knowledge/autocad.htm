<h3>AutoCAD</h3>
<p>AutoCAD is a computer-aided drafting software program used for creating blueprints
 for buildings, bridges and computer chips. AutoCAD is used mainly by drafters, 
 although engineers, surveyors and architects may need to use the software from time to time.</p>
<p>It is a 2-D and 3-D computer-aided drafting software application used in architecture,
 construction and manufacturing to assist in the preparation of blueprints and other engineering 
 plans. Professionals who use AutoCAD are often referred to as drafters. While drafters work in
 a number of specialties, the six most common specialization areas are mechanical drafting,
 architectural drafting, civil drafting, electrical drafting, electronics drafting and aeronautical drafting.

</p>
<p>
Mechanical drafters prepare plans for machinery and mechanical devices. Architectural
 drafters draw up plans for residential and commercial buildings. Civil drafters draw up
 plans for use in the design and building of roadways, bridges, sewer systems and other major projects.

Electrical drafters work with electricians to prepare diagrams of wiring electrical
 system layouts. Electronics drafters also prepare wiring diagrams for use in the making,
 installing and repairing of electronic gadgets. Aeronautical drafters create blueprints
 used in assembling aircraft and other related apparatus. With such kind of wide applicability AutoCAD is a kind of industry standard for 3D designing.</p>

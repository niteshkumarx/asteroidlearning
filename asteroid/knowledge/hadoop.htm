<h3>Hadoop</h3>
<p>The Apache Hadoop project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing.

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing 
of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed
 to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and 
 storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is
 designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available
 service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.</p>
<p>A wide variety of companies and organizations use Hadoop for both research and production.
 Users are encouraged to add themselves to the Hadoop. Hadoop was initially developed as a project
 from Yahoo, and most of its part is also developed by Facebook.</p>
<p>
Imagine how large sets of data on Facebook is accessed to you within seconds, searching your own computer may not be as fast as you get it on Google.
What if you have to analyse a large set of data like in Petabytes in limited time. If you're curious about such things then Hadoop is for you.</p>

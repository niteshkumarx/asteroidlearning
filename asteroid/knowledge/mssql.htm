<h3>XAMPP</h3>
<p>XAMPP is a free and open source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends,
 consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and interpreters for scripts written in the
 PHP and Perl programming languages.</p>
<p>XAMPP's designers intended it for use only as a development tool, to allow website designers
 and programmers to test their work on their own computers without any access to the Internet. XAMPP also provides 
 support for creating and manipulating databases in MySQL and SQLite among others.
Once XAMPP is installed, it is possible to treat a localhost like a remote host by connected using an FTP client.</p>

<h3>Adobe Illustrator </h3>
<p>Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor developed and marketed by Adobe Systems.
It is a vector drawing program often used to draw illustrations, cartoons, diagrams, charts and logos. Unlike bitmap images
 that stores information in a grid of dots, Illustrator uses mathematical equations to draw out the shapes.
 This makes vector graphics scalable without the loss of resolution.</p>
<p>
So why would we need a vector graphics editor when we already have one on raster, we do have some benefits.
<br><br><span style="color:#00AEEF;">
Scalable without resolution loss
<br>Lines are crisp and sharp at any sizes
<br>Print at high resolution
<br>Smaller file size
<br>Good for drawing illustrations
<br>Used in Web, Apps, Infographics, Logos</span></p>
<p>Photoshop does have some limited vector capabilities, but no where near
 what you can achieve in Illustrator. Instead of being comprised of static
 individual pixels, vector graphics are mathematically drawn by your computer
 and can therefore be drastically changed with absolutely zero loss in quality.

What this means on a practical level is that when you create art in Illustrator,
 no matter what its original size is, at any time you want you can make it as big
 as a billboard or as small as a thumb tac. This has major positive implications
 to the way you work.</p>

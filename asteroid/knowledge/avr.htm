<h3>AVR</h3>
<p>The AVR is 8-bit RISC 
single-chip microcontroller, which was developed by Atmel . The AVR is one of the first microcontroller families
 to use on-chip flash memory for program storage.</p>
<p>
The high-performance, low-power Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller
 combines 16KB of programmable flash memory, 1KB SRAM, 512B EEPROM, 
 an 8-channel 10-bit A/D converter, and a JTAG interface for on-chip debugging.
 The device supports throughput of 16 MIPS at 16 MHz and operates between 4.5-5.5 volts.
By executing instructions in a single clock cycle, the device
 achieves throughputs approaching 1 MIPS per MHz, balancing power consumption and processing speed.
 The one line description about AVR is its a kind of microcontroller on which you can
 burn your programs to make electronic components function according to you.</p>

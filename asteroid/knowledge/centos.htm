<h3>Cent OS</h3>
<p>What is CentOS? <br><br>
CentOS Linux is a community-supported distribution derived
 from sources freely provided to the public by Red Hat for
 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). As such, CentOS Linux aims
 to be functionally compatible with RHEL. The CentOS Project
 mainly changes packages to remove upstream vendor branding
 and artwork. CentOS Linux is no cost and free to redistribute.
 A new CentOS version is
 released approximately every year and each CentOS 
 version is periodically updated roughly every 6 months
 to support newer hardware. This results in a secure, 
 low-maintenance, reliable, predictable and reproducible Linux environment.</p>

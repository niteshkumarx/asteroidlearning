<h3>XML</h3>
<p>XML stands for EXtensible Markup Language was designed to store and transport data.
XML was designed to be both human and machine-readable.</p>
<p>XAMPP's designers intended it for use only as a development tool, to allow website designers
 and programmers to test their work on their own computers without any access to the Internet. XAMPP also provides 
 support for creating and manipulating databases in MySQL and SQLite among others.
Once XAMPP is installed, it is possible to treat a localhost like a remote host by connected using an FTP client.</p>

XML Simplifies Things
<br><br><span style="color:#00AEEF;">
It simplifies data sharing
<br>It simplifies data transport
<br>It simplifies platform changes
<br>It simplifies data availability
</span></p>
<p>
Many computer systems contain data in incompatible formats. Exchanging data between incompatible systems or upgraded systems is a time-consuming task for web developers. Large amounts of data must be converted, and incompatible data is often lost.
XML stores data in plain text format. This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data.
XML also makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers, without losing data.
With XML, data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines" like people, computers, voice machines, news feeds, etc.

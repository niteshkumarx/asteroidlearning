<h3>Cascading Style Sheets</h3>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
 of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style
 of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to
 any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech,
 or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most
 websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user
 interfaces for many mobile applications.</p>
<p>CSS can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
 specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share
 formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate external file, and reduce complexity
 and repetition in the structural content, such as semantically insignificant tables that
 were widely used to format pages before consistent CSS rendering was available in all
 major browsers. CSS makes it possible to separate presentation instructions from the
 HTML content in a separate file or style section of the HTML file. For each matching
 HTML element, it provides a list of formatting instructions.</p>
<p>You can style thousands and thousands of HTML pages just with a single CSS, works like magic.</p>

<h3>Photography Basics</h3>
<p>You can do photography with even the simplest of cameras,
 but the principles that we would like to teach are for people
 who want to learn to use at least a camera that allows the photographer
 to adjust the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO.  Even some pocket cameras have this functionality now a days.</p>
<p>Its not very necessary to have a very expensive cameras or camcorders the science lies in the fact that how you're gonna use it.
For example When photographers talk about "exposure," we simply mean the brightness 
or darkness of a photo.  It seems simple enough to take a photo that is correctly
 exposed has the proper brightness or darkness, but in reality it can be quite the trick. Likewise The shutter
 is a small curtain in the camera that quickly rolls over the image sensor the digital version of film and 
 allows light to shine onto the imaging sensor for a fraction of a second. But does it makes a difference.</p>
<p>
Yes, it does in fact a lot. There's no impact of how better we know to edit if our raw clips are not the best.
 Photography is quite easy and interesting and doesn't take long to understand how ever all depends on your photographic experience.

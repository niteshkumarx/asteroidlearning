<h3>Hive</h3>
<p>The Apache Hive data warehouse software facilitates querying and managing large datasets 
residing in distributed storage. Hive provides a mechanism to project structure onto
 this data and query the data using a SQL-like language called HiveQL. At the same 
 time this language also allows traditional map/reduce programmers to plug in their 
 custom mappers and reducers when it is inconvenient or inefficient to express this logic in HiveQL.</p>
<p>Facilities provided by Hive<br><br/>Indexing
<br>Different storage types such as plain text, CSV, RCFile, HBase.
<br>Metadata storage in an RDBMS, significantly reducing the time to perform semantic checks during query execution.
<br>Built-in user defined functions (UDFs) to manipulate dates, strings, and other data-mining tools. 
<br>SQL-like queries (HiveQL), which are implicitly converted into MapReduce.</p>

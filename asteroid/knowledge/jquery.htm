<h3>JQuery</h3>
<p>JQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.</p>
<p>jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document,
 select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications.
 JQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the
 JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level
 interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets.
 The modular approach to the JQuery library allows the creation of powerful
 dynamic web pages and web applications.</p>
<p>JQuery may be a good option for simple event handling that goes beyond basic DOM
 element selection and manipulation. The event assignment and the event callback
 function definition are done in a single step in a single location in the code.
JQuery also aims to incorporate other highly used JavaScript functionality.</p>

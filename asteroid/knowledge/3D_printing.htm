<h3>3D Printing</h3>
<p>3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three
 dimensional solid objects from a digital file. The creation of a 3D
 printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive
 process an object is created by laying down successive layers of 
 material until the entire object is created. Each of these layers 
 can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object.</p>
<p>
It all starts with making a virtual design of the object you want to create. 
This virtual design is made in a CAD (Computer Aided Design) file using a 3
D modeling program (for the creation of a totally new object) or 
with the use of a 3D scanner (to copy an existing object). A 3D 
scanner makes a 3D digital copy of an object.
3d scanners use different technologies to generate a 3d model such as 
time-of-flight, structured / modulated light, volumetric scanning and many more.</p>

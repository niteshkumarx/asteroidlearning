<h3>Eclipse</h3>
<p>Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). 
It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment.
 Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications, 
 but it may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages through the 
 use of plugins like C and C++. We do use eclipse to create and burn C programs to AVR to create robotics functionality.</p>

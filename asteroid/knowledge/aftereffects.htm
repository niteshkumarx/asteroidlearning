<h3>Adobe After Effects</h3>
<p>Adobe After Effects is software primarily used for creating motion graphics and visual effects.
 It allows users to animate, edit, and compose media 2D or 3D space with many different built-in tools
 and third party plug-ins which can be downloaded from the Internet depending on what type of plug
 in the user is looking for. It also provides individual attention to variables like parallax and
 also user adjustable angles of observation.
Adobe After Effects is a layer-oriented program software. Each individual media object like video clips,
 still images, audio clips and more. runs on its own. In contrast, other Non-Linear Editing Systems use a
 system where individual media objects can occupy the same track as long as they do not overlap at the 
 same time. This track-oriented system is more suitable for editing and can keep project files more simple.
 The layer oriented system that Adobe After Effects has is suitable for extensive video effects work and 
 also key framing. Adobe After Effects is capable of countering the problem somewhat by selectively
 hiding layers or by grouping them into pre-compositions.</p>
<p>
After Effects has extensive plug-in support; a broad range of third party plug-ins are available.
 A variety of plug-in styles exist, such as particle systems for realistic effects for rain, snow, fire.
With or without third-party plug-ins, After Effects can render 3D effects. Some of these 3D plug-ins use 
basic 2D layers from After Effects.
In addition to 3D effects, there are plug-ins for making video look like film or cartoons; simulating
 fire, smoke, or water; particle systems; slow motion; creating animated charts, graphs, and other 
 data visualization; calculating the 3D movement of a camera in a 2D video shot; eliminating flicker, 
 noise, or rigging lines; translating timelines from FCP or Avid; adding high-end color correction; 
 and other workflow improvements and visual effects.</p>
 <p>We're sure you're gonna love After Effects.

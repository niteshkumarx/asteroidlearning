<h3>Linux Hosting</h3>
<p>Windows and Linux are the two types of platforms, which
 are typically available for web hosting. Kindly note that
 these web hosting platforms are independent of the operating system you use.

If you have a static website which is made of HTML and CSS 
then you can host your website on both the platforms. The 
choice of the platform would be majorly based on the type 
of scripting language you use for your website. This is 
primarily because of their inheritance with a specific platform. 
 For example if you use PHP and MySQL for your website then you 
 should ideally host your website on Linux. </p>
<p>
Linux is an UNIX based and open source platform that is predominantly
 used for Website hosting. LAMP is the most important feature of Linux.
 LAMP is an acronym used for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl/PHP/Python.
 LAMP signifies combination of software and server technologies which are open
 source and thus making Linux web hosting offers optimal solution to website
 hosting with limited budget.</p>

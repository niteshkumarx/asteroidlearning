<h3>Networking</h3>
<p>Linux itself is just a kernel. Linux can be configured as a networked 
workstation, a DNS server, a DHCP server, a web server, a mail server,
 a file and print server, database server, a firewall, a gateway router
 and many more. Is Linux can be all that? Yes it can. In this section, 
 user will learn the true meaning of Linux, which is a network operating 
 system or server system, to be all that mention above.

The first thing you should learn about networking is ip addresses.
 A server and a client computer must have an ip address so that it can be reach in network environment.</p>
<p>

a proof that Linux is a very stable and secure network operating system when 
properly configured and maintained. All that starts with setting up a network
 card and configure an ip address for the server. A whole more things are to be known with Asteroid Learning.</p>

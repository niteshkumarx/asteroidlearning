<h3>Adobe Audition</h3>
<p>Adobe Audition is a digital audio workstation from Adobe Systems featuring both a multitrack
, non-destructive mix/edit environment and a destructive-approach waveform editing view.</p>
<p>
What are movies without sound effects and sound dubbing, if you really in charge of
 creating amazing sound editing experiences the Adobe Audition is for you. Standard features for
 editing audio files are integrated such as cutting, pasting, cropping and combining audio files 
 so as to create your song. Adobe Audition can produce a result worthy of a professional studio 
 mixing with numbers of special effects such as reverb, multitap delay, 3D echo, equalizers,
 chorus, flanger and distortion. Being an audio editing software, Adobe Audition has been
 designed to be able to mix up to 128 tracks all of them with professional results. And 
 of course, it also allows individual edition. For this latest version, the multi-track
 recording option is enabled. The burning feature is very interesting in the sense that
 through it, the software can edit music files up to 2GB in term of size. It is worth
 to note here that the program is equipped with a Blu-ray burning which makes the editing
 audio even better. Users are given the entire freedom to remove sound from a music
 track in a matter of clicks. Several effects are made available at users' disposal 
 such as sound remover effect, stereo expander and pitch bender.

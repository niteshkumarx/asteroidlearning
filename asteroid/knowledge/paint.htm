<h3>Paint </h3>
<p>Paint (formerly Paintbrush for Windows) is a simple computer graphics program that has been included
 with all versions of Microsoft Windows.It is often referred to as MS Paint or Microsoft Paint. The program
 mainly opens and saves files as Windows bitmap (24-bit, 256 color, 16 color, and monochrome, all with the .bmp extension),
 JPEG, GIF (without animation or transparency, although the Windows 98 version, a Windows 95 upgrade, and the
 Windows NT4 version did support the latter), PNG (without alpha channel), and single-page TIFF. The
 program can be in color mode or two-color black-and-white, but there is no grayscale mode. For its
 simplicity, it rapidly became one of the most used applications in the early versions of Windows-introducing
 many to painting on a computer for the first time-and is still widely used for very simple image manipulation tasks.</p>
<p>People, might not notice but we can do many sorts of basic photo editing and authoring in paint. And when it comes to
file format conversion, screen captures and basic typography, nothing beats paint. We got some really awesome tricks
to create graphics simply by using paint that you will wonder if its happening.</p>

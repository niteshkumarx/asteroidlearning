<h3>Unity</h3>
<p>Unity is a flexible and powerful development platform for creating multiplatform 
3D and 2D interactive experiences. It's a complete ecosystem for anyone who aims to 
build a business on creating high-end content and connecting to their most loyal 
and enthusiastic players.</p>
<p>Unity is made to empower you to create the best interactive entertainment 
or multimedia experience that you can. This manual is designed to help you
 learn how to use Unity, from basic to advanced techniques. </p>
<p>
Unity allows specification of texture compression and resolution settings
 for each platform the game engine supports, and provides support for bump
 mapping, reflection mapping, parallax mapping, screen space ambient occlusion, dynamic
 shadows using shadow maps, render-to-texture and full-screen post-processing effects.
 Unity's graphics engine's platform diversity can provide a shader with multiple
 variants and a declarative fallback specification, allowing Unity to detect the
 best variant for the current video hardware; and if none are compatible, fall
 back to an alternative shader that may sacrifice features for performance.
The game engine's scripting is built on Mono.</p>

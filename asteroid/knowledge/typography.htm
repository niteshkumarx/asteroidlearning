<h3>Typography</h3>
<p>Every designer needs to understand typography.
Typography is, quite simply, the art and technique of arranging type. It's central
 to the work and skills of a designer and is about much more than making the words legible.

Your choice of typeface and how you make it work with your layout, grid, colour
 scheme, design theme and so on will make the difference between a good, bad and great design.

Good typography is partly down to creative intuition, but it's impossible to become
 skilled in typography without understanding the basic rules of the craft, even if you mean to break them.</p>
<p>There are an astonishing array of professional fonts to choose from.
 But with great power comes great responsibility. Just because
 you can choose from a vast library doesn't mean you have to.</p>
<p>It can be really attracting, and easy to spread messages using typography. With us you will definitely enjoy it.</p>

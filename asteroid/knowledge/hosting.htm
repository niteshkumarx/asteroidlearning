<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p>What it takes to make your website pages visible on the web. Once you're ready with your html
 and script files you need to transfer them to a web server. There are some tools you need to be familiar with like C-Panel and DNS Handler.</p>
<p>A server is nothing but a powerful computer just like your home system which is designed specially to serve files to the web.</p>
<p>Servers are configured to serve to even hundreds of requests per second and then to not hanging up the system. We have a live session on servers
and hosting plus security issues you should take care while hosting your html.</p>

<h3>DVD Authoring</h3>
<p>DVD authoring is the process of creating a DVD video capable of playing on a DVD player.</p>
<p>DVD authoring is the second step in the process of producing finished DVDs.
 The first step is the creation of the movie (or programme) and the second,
 the authoring, is the creation of artwork, user menus, insertion of chapter points,
 overdubs/commentaries, setting autoplay and/or repeat options, etc. The final step is
 the manufacturing (replication) process to mass-produce finished DVDs.</p>
<p>Once you've created your final DVD you just need to replicate them using replicating systems,
 and its ready to be published into market.</p>

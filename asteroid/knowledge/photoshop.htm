<h3>Adobe Photoshop </h3>
<p>Be <br><br><span style="color:#FDC010;">Photographer <br>Videographers <br>Designers <br>3D Illustrations <br>Web Graphics<br><br></span> Adobe Photoshop is the industry standard for all of these. Nothing beats it in its domain.</p>
<p>There's nothing in graphics you can't do in Photoshop, infact you can not imagine the world without it.Photoshop files have default file extension as .PSD,
 which stands for "Photoshop Document." A PSD file stores an image with support for most imaging options available in Photoshop.
 These include layers with masks, transparency, text, alpha channels and spot colors, clipping paths, and duotone settings.</p>
<p>Before any type of print media is published, whether it is a magazine, newspaper, or even novel, it is likely the case that
 Photoshop has been used to enhance and clean up the imagery on many if not all of the pages. Magazines use Photoshop
 and many of its tools in order to enhance the imagery and text in their publications. Many Health and Beauty Magazines
 employ in-house designers to retouch photos of models to enhance their beauty. They add finishing touches to the
 imagery by using tools that balance color and add drop shadows, among other edits. There seems no limitations to Photoshop except one. Its only for raster type images.</p>

<h3>Java</h3>
<p>Java is a programming language and computing platform initially released by Sun Microsystems. 
There are lots of applications and websites that may not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day.
 Java is generally secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific 
 supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, a small amount of Java can seen everywhere.</p>
<p>Android applications are developed using the Java language. As of now, that's really your
 only option for native applications. Java is a very popular programming language developed 
 by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). Developed long after C and C++, Java incorporates
 many of the powerful features of those powerful languages while addressing some of their
 drawbacks. Still, programming languages are only as powerful as their libraries. These 
 libraries exist to help developers build applications.</p>
<p>
Android relies heavily on these Java fundamentals.
 The Android SDK includes many standard Java libraries 
 (data structure libraries, math libraries, graphics libraries,
 networking libraries and everything else you could want) as
 well as special Android libraries that will help you develop
 awesome Android applications.

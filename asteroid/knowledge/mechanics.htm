<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<p>Robotics spans multiple scientific and engineering disciplines,
 so when you want to design a better robot you should get some basic
 knowledge in these fields. How much you should learn depends on how
 complex you want to make your robot.</p>
<p>Mechanics is one of them. You'll seriously end up by just creating a path 
follower robot if you do not carry a deep sense in mechanics and automation.</p>
<p>
Mechanics helps keeping a robot in balance. Although you could build a robot
 without knowing anything about mechanics, it'll help in preventing your robot 
 from tipping over when turning, or when picking up something.

Another point where mechanics pays off are axles. On small robots you can attach
 the wheels directly to the output shaft of the motor. However this doesn't work 
 well for larger robots as this puts a lot of stress on the internals of the motor.
 A better way is to attach the wheel to an axle, and use gears to connect the 
 motor to the axle. Knowledge of mechanics allows you to build such constructs.

If your robot is a small line follower almost any building material will work.
 However if your robot weighs a few kilos, something sturdier than cardboard and
 soda sippers is appropriate. And if your robot is human size you should consider
 metal and/or composite construction.
<br>Mechanics is about<br/><br><span style="color:#00AEEF;">

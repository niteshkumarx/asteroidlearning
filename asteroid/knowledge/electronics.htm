<h3>Electronic Components</h3>
<p>We wish you to be very familiar about basic electronics that's required
 for building electronic circuits and in wiring of electronic components.
 An electronic component is any basic discrete device or physical entity in
 an electronic system used to affect electrons or their associated fields.
 Electronic components are mostly industrial products, available in a singular
 form and are not to be confused with electrical elements, which are conceptual 
 abstractions representing idealized electronic components.
Electronic components have two or more electrical terminals (or leads)
 aside from antennas which may only have one terminal. These leads connect
 to create an electronic circuit with a particular function (for example
 an amplifier, radio receiver, or oscillator). Basic electronic components 
 may be packaged discretely, as arrays or networks of like components, or 
 integrated inside of packages such as semiconductor integrated circuits, 
 hybrid integrated circuits, or thick film devices. </p>

We do have three types of electronic components
<br><br><span style="color:#00AEEF;">
Active components rely on a source of energy (usually from the DC circuit, which
 we have chosen to ignore) and usually can inject power into a circuit, though
 this is not part of the definition. Active components include amplifying
 components such as transistors, triode vacuum tubes (valves), and tunnel diodes.
<br><br>Passive components can't introduce net energy into the circuit. They also can't
 rely on a source of power, except for what is available from the (AC) circuit 
 they are connected to. As a consequence they can't amplify (increase the power 
 of a signal), although they may increase a voltage or current (such as is done 
 by a transformer or resonant circuit). Passive components include two-terminal 
 components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transformers.
<br><br>Electromechanical components can carry out electrical operations by
 using moving parts or by using electrical connections

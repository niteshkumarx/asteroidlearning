<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Linux is a computer operating system which is free and is under the model of free 
and open source software development and distribution. Linux is a UNIX-like operating 
system that is available as an alternative to commercial operating systems such as Windows,
 UNIX, or Macintosh OS. Because Linux is open source software so users have access to the
 source code and are allowed to use, modify, or redistribute the codes.  </p>
<p>With thousands of minds focused on improving the software,
 Linux rapidly became a fast, reliable, and widespread operating system.
 What perhaps endeared Linux most to so many people who volunteered their
 efforts was the fact that the basic Linux operating system was, is and 
 continues to be free. in simplest terms, an operating system. In simpler terms it is the
 software on a computer that enables applications and the computer operator to access the 
 devices on the computer to perform desired functions.

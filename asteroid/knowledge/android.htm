<h3>Android</h3>
<p>Android is the world's most popular mobile platform
Android powers hundreds of millions of mobile devices in
 more than 190 countries around the world. It's the largest
 installed base of any mobile platform and growing fast-every
 day another million users power up their Android devices for
 the first time and start looking for apps, games, and other digital content.

Android gives you a world-class platform for creating apps 
and games for Android users everywhere, as well as an open
 marketplace for distributing to them instantly.</p>
<p>
Android gives you everything you need to build best-in-class
 app experiences. It gives you a single application model that
 lets you deploy your apps broadly to hundreds of millions of users 
 across a wide range of devices-from phones to tablets and beyond.

Android also gives you tools for creating apps that look great and take
 advantage of the hardware capabilities available on each device.
 It automatically adapts your UI to look its best on each device,
 while giving you as much control as you want over your UI on different device types</p>
 <p>You can create a single app binary that's optimized for both phone and tablet form factors.
 You declare your UI in lightweight sets of XML resources, one set for parts of the 
 UI that are common to all form factors and other sets for optimizations specific
 to phones or tablets. At runtime, Android applies the correct resource sets based
 on its screen size, density, locale, and so on.</p>

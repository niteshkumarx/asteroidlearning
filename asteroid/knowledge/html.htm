<h3>Hyper Text Markup Language</h3>
<p>HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
 Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible layouts
 or simply web pages. It describes the structure of a website semantically
 along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather
 than a programming language.
HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites. HTML allows
 images and objects to be embedded and can be used to create interactive
 forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
 structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</p>
<p>We can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behaviour of HTML web pages allowing some client side applications .
How ever a simple HTML page may not look so elegant like we always hope, we try but end up with a very basic kind of web page.
 We need some stylesheets for it.</p>
<p>A HTML code may not look lovely to a beginner but believe after you understand some basics you will love HTML. At the beginning you may feel
HTML as a basic tool to create web pages but you will be surprised to know at the end of the day every thing that we see on out of a browser is HTML. </p>

<h3>Scoop</h3>
<p>Sqoop is a command-line interface application for transferring
 data between relational databases and Hadoop. It supports incremental
 loads of a single table or a free form SQL query as well as saved 
 jobs which can be run multiple times to import updates made to a
 database since the last import. Imports can also be used to 
 populate tables in Hive or HBase. Exports can be used to put 
 data from Hadoop into a relational database.</p>
<p>Scoop is for structured data whereas there's another CLI Flume which an be used for non-organized data.</p>
